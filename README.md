  1) Rotate positions around graph
  2) Move regressions inside discrete vs not, so it's not wastefully running regs

  3) <Figure out why the text looks so crappy [done in Shosh branch]>
  4) Connected line graphs
  5) label graphs
  6) <Change input syntax using dplyr quoting conventions (http://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/programming.html) [done at least partially in shosh branch]>
  7) <Allow for factored control variables [done (hopefully) in shosh branch)>
