# binscattr

* Todo:
  1) Rotate postiions around graph
  2) Move regressions inside discrete vs not, so it's not wastefully running regs
  3) Figure out why the text looks so crappy [done in Shosh branch]
  4) Connected line graphs
  5) label graphs
  6) Change input syntax using dplyr quoting conventions (http://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/programming.html)
